# API Tester

The main goal of this tool is to test the basic correctness of the API. It will run as a late step in a Continuous Integration process, consuming the REST API after it has already been deployed.

A series of black box tests will be run focusing on:
- the HTTP response code
- other HTTP headers in the response
- the payload (JSON)

Each test will only be focused on a **single responsability**.

Another important aspect of the integration tests is adherence to the *Single Level of Abstraction Principle* â€“ the logic within a test should be written at a high level.
